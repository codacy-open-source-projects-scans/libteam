.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
teamd is a daemon to control a given team network device, during runtime,
as a puppeteer controls a puppet. It uses libteam to communicate with the
kernel team device instance via Netlink sockets. The behaviour depends on
the selected runner and its configuration. This daemon is part of the
libteam project.
